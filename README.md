Doug, The Power Platform Pretender

I want to understand how to create useful Low-Code apps using the Microsoft Power Platform. I already use Power BI in my work as a Data Analyst. I have been coding normally on the side for a while. 

I have discovered that trying to use the normal flow to create a program. My habit is to define the problem, draw up a sample interface, test functions, connect to data sources, and iterate. 
I didn't get the results i expected 

To back up a step, I had a test case. I want to make an app to calculate my car fuel efficency. I want to do both american and normal measurements. (mpg and 'litres per 100 kilometer'). Partly, because I wanted to see the change in efficiency going from 10mpg to 20mpg to 30mpg..to 50mpg. I read that the change in mpg is not linear in the same way as km. Secondly, if efficiency changes, either my driving is changing or something has changed in the operation of the engine.

I drew out a screen with boxes. put some functions to calculate things. It was working fine. So I said, lets connect to a data source now. Maybe a spreadsheet in my OneDrive space. Hm. Not as I expected. 

Then I tried a second thing where I connected to the Data Source first. Also not as I expected. Even though I requested a 'blank' canvas app, powerstuff created the app for me, only it doesn't do anything I wanted to do and does things I didn't want it to do.

The silver lining of this cloud is that I can see something that is broken for me, something I don't understand, and a good place to focus some learning energy.

Doug, The Power Platform Pretender

I want to understand how to create useful Low-Code apps using the Microsoft Power Platform. I already use Power BI in my work as a Data Analyst. I have been coding normally on the side for a while. 

I have discovered that trying to use the normal flow to create a program. My habit is to define the problem, draw up a sample interface, test functions, connect to data sources, and iterate. 
I didn't get the results i expected 

To back up a step, I had a test case. I want to make an app to calculate my car fuel efficency. I want to do both american and normal measurements. (mpg and 'litres per 100 kilometer'). Partly, because I wanted to see the change in efficiency going from 10mpg to 20mpg to 30mpg..to 50mpg. I read that the change in mpg is not linear in the same way as km
